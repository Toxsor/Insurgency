  "body": "### Welcome to my project: Respected Gaming Servers.\r\nThis projected is hosted openly on GitHub and available for all to download. I will not be including our server config files as those hold vital information so please stop asking me. This project will change a lot depending on the amount of time I have and the changes seen here aren't necessarily live on the servers hosted by RGServers.\r\n\r\n### Server List\r\n**74.91.120.243:27016** - Coop 18 Players\r\n<br />\r\n**104.255.229.12:27015** - PvP 32 Players\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nThanks to Sourcemod/Metamod for giving the ability to have addons. Special thanks for jballou's cvar list and additional addons. Go to his official [website](http://jballou.com/insurgency/) for his plugins! Special thanks to SERNIX (specifically [Daimyo21](https://github.com/Daimyo21)) for some of their work on some custom plugins. Thanks to Lua for the ability to add custom sounds and models for new weapons on our server. (Since I am not exactly sure who gave out the models and sounds, I am sorry.)\r\n",
