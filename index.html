<p>This projected is hosted openly on GitHub and available for all to download. I will not be including our server config files as those hold vital information so please stop asking me. This project will change a lot depending on the amount of time I have and the changes seen here aren't necessarily live on the servers hosted by RGServers.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sourcemod/Metamod for giving the ability to have addons. Special thanks for jballou's cvar list and additional addons. Go to his official <a href="http://jballou.com/insurgency/">website</a> for his plugins! Special thanks to SERNIX (specifically <a href="https://github.com/Daimyo21">Daimyo21</a>) for some of their work on some custom plugins. Thanks to Lua for the ability to add custom sounds and models for new weapons on our server. (Since I am not exactly sure who gave out the models and sounds, I am sorry.)</p>
