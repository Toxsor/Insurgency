Adds check_ammo command that client runs and gets RO2-style "Mag feels mostly full" estimation of remaining ammo. Reloading will also pop this up to alert player if they have inserted a magazine that is less than full. There are other workarounds and todos in the source code as well. Release candidate, no obvious bugs, but still needs a lot of polish.
